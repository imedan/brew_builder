# brew_builder

This is a simple tool to build a home brew recipe within a Jupyter Notebook. This code uses the database of ingredients from [Brewtarget](https://github.com/Brewtarget/brewtarget) in order to formulate recipes. The assumptions made in this are very simple (as I only do extract/partial mash brews), so this formulator may not be ideal for more complicated brews with multiple mash steps.

To see an example use of this code, look at the example Jupyter Notebook in this repository.

# Demo Notebook

The demo notebook can be used and run on your own machine. Within this repository, if you would like to look at the dome with the interactive cells used for searching the database and editing recipes, look at the brew_builder_demo.html file.
